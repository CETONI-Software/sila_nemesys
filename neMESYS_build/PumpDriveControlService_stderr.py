:details: pumpdrivecontrolservice_server_real: 
        Functionality to control and maintain the drive that drives the pump.
        Allows to initialize a pump (e.g. by executing a reference move) and obtain status information about the pump drive's current state (i.e. enabled/disabled).
        The initialization has to be successful in order for the pump to work correctly and dose fluids. If the initialization fails, the StandardExecutionError InitializationFailed is thrown.
